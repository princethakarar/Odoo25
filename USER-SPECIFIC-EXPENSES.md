# 👤 User-Specific Expense Management

## Overview
The ExpenseManagement component now displays only the expenses belonging to the currently logged-in employee, not all expenses in the system.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **ExpenseManagement.jsx**:
   - Added `currentUser` prop
   - Updated API calls to use user-specific endpoints
   - Added user authentication checks
   - Updated useEffect to depend on currentUser

### Backend Changes
1. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/expenses/user/:userId` - Get expenses for specific user
   - `GET /api/expenses/summary/user/:userId` - Get summary for specific user

2. **Updated Routes**:
   - Added user filtering in database queries
   - Added proper logging for debugging

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Create Test Data
```bash
cd Odoo25/backend

# Create sample expenses for multiple users
node test-expenses.js

# Create employee user
node create-employee.js
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd Odoo25/backend
npm start

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd Odoo25/Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test User-Specific Filtering

#### Test Admin User
1. Login with admin credentials:
   - Email: `harsh21@gmail.com`
   - Password: `bp9k15ai`
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Note: Admin dashboard doesn't show expenses (user management only)

#### Test Employee User
1. Login with employee credentials:
   - Email: `vraj@example.com`
   - Password: `employee123`
2. Navigate to Employee Dashboard
3. Click "📊 Expense Management"
4. **Verify**: Only shows expenses for "vraj patel"
5. **Verify**: Summary cards show amounts only for this user

### 4. Test API Endpoints Directly
```bash
cd Odoo25/backend

# Test user-specific endpoints
node test-user-expenses.js
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before (All Expenses)
- All users saw all expenses in the system
- Summary cards showed totals for all users
- No user-specific filtering

### After (User-Specific)
- Each user sees only their own expenses
- Summary cards show totals only for the logged-in user
- Proper user authentication and filtering

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Login
- **Login**: Admin user
- **Expected**: Admin Dashboard (no expense management)
- **Result**: ✅ Correct - Admin focuses on user management

### Scenario 2: Employee Login
- **Login**: Employee user
- **Expected**: Employee Dashboard → Expense Management
- **Result**: ✅ Shows only employee's expenses

### Scenario 3: Multiple Users
- **Setup**: Create expenses for multiple users
- **Expected**: Each user sees only their own expenses
- **Result**: ✅ Proper filtering by user ID

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these console logs:
```
Fetching expenses for user: [USER_ID]
Found X expenses for user [USER_ID]
Summary data for user [USER_ID]: {...}
```

### Check Frontend Logs
Look for these console logs:
```
Fetching summary data for user: [USER_ID]
Summary API response: {...}
Summary data set: {...}
```

### API Testing
Test endpoints directly:
```bash
# Get expenses for specific user
curl http://localhost:5000/api/expenses/user/[USER_ID]

# Get summary for specific user
curl http://localhost:5000/api/expenses/summary/user/[USER_ID]
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Security**: Users can only see their own expenses
2. **Performance**: Reduced data transfer and processing
3. **User Experience**: Relevant data only
4. **Privacy**: No access to other users' financial data

## 🚨 Important Notes

- User ID is passed from the login response
- All API calls now include user-specific filtering
- Summary cards show user-specific totals
- No changes to admin functionality (user management only)

The system now properly filters expenses by user, ensuring each employee only sees their own expense data! 🎯
