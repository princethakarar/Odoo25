# 🎭 Role-Based Authentication System

## Overview
The expense management system now supports role-based authentication with separate dashboards for Admin and Employee users.

## 🔐 User Roles

### Admin Users
- **Dashboard**: Admin Dashboard
- **Features**: 
  - User management (create, view, manage users)
  - Send passwords to users
  - View all system data
- **Access**: Full system access

### Employee Users
- **Dashboard**: Employee Dashboard
- **Features**:
  - Expense Management (main feature)
  - Submit new expenses
  - View personal expense history
  - Profile management
- **Access**: Limited to expense-related features

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Login Process
When a user logs in:
1. System checks email and password
2. Retrieves user data including role
3. Routes to appropriate dashboard:
   - `role === 'Admin'` → Admin Dashboard
   - `role === 'Employee'` → Employee Dashboard

### 2. Navigation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Focuses on user management
- **Employee Dashboard**: Focuses on expense management
- **Expense Management**: Accessible from Employee Dashboard only

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Test Users
```bash
cd Odoo25/backend

# Create sample data
node test-expenses.js

# Create employee user
node create-employee.js
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd Odoo25/backend
npm start

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd Odoo25/Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Different Roles

#### Admin Login
- **Email**: `harsh21@gmail.com` (or your admin email)

- **Result**: Redirects to Admin Dashboard

#### Employee Login
